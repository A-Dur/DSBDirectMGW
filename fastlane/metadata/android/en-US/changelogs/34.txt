Thanks to Moritz Zwerger's contribution, filters can now be disabled temporarily by touching the "eye" icon, and with collaboration of Jasper Michalke, there is now a Notice board view that displays items from the "Aushänge" and "News" sections for schools that make use of this feature.

Due to the existance of trademark law, this piece of software is being renamed to "ESBDirect". If you come up with a better and cooler name, please inform us about it.
