# DSBDirect
This Android client software can access a certain **substitution plan** distribution system (aliased **ESB** for *Elektronisches Schwarzes Brett*) which is widely spread in the German-speaking area.

It has been developed independently from heinekingmedia and implements the same functionality as their app.

* Displays entries in a nice, native list which you can filter
* Alternatively displays the raw website or image
* View older versions of your plan, stored locally
* Notifications containing your only entries
* Replace shortcodes with teacher's full names
* View the "News" and "Aush√§nge" sections
* Loads relatively quickly

## Download (original version)

Android 4.0 and up. Notification on Android 5 and up. (Nowadays, nobody has Android 4 anymore. Truly.)
